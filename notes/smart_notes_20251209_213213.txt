• Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s cricket journey began in the by-lanes of Ranchi, Jharkhand
• Born on July 7, 1981, Dhoni didn’t start off as a cricketer
• In fact, during his school days at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, he was more inclined towards football and played as a goalkeeper
• It was only on his school coach’s suggestion that he tried wicketkeeping in cricket—and the rest, as they say, is history
